		"content": "<p>Hello, I'm Jhon Doe â€”<em>a web developer somewhere between visual minimalism and well-seasoned code</em>. If something can be refactored, you'll find me there with a flashlight and a cup of sugar-free coffee.</p><p>I specialize in adopting existing projects and giving them a second life: organizing styles, reducing page weight, and making everything run as smoothly as warm butter.</p><p>Outside the code editor, I enjoy studying interface design with Figma (currently building my first interactive prototypes), learning how to improve the user experience, and collecting keyboard shortcuts like vintage coins.</p>"
